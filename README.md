# Computer Vision course
 A course in computer science focusing on basic theory, models, and methods for computer vision, image analysis and image processing.
 ## Grades received in the labs
 - Lab 1: A
 - Lab 2: B
 - Lab 3: A

## Intended learning outcomes
After completing the course with a passing grade the student should be able to:
- identify basic concepts, terminology, models and methods in computer vision and image processing-
- develop and evaluate a number of basic methods in computer vision and image processing systematically
- choose and apply methods for processing of image data related to image filtrering, image enhancement, segmentation, classification and representation,
- account for basic methods in computer vision as multiscale representation, detection of edges and other distinctive features, stereo, movement and object recognition to
- later as a working professional be able to decide how basic possibilities and limitations influence the choice of methods in image processing and computer vision for specific applications
- independently be able to implement, analyse and evaluate simple methods for computer vision and image processing
- be able to read and apply professional literature in the area.
